Directory Structure for Testing

Some call it integration testing, others call it
unit testing, I say lets call it "good old necessary testing" :-)

BTW, all the file extension will `.yaml` (not, `.yml` or any other
smart names, because [official doc](http://www.yaml.org/faq.html) says using `.yaml` when possible)
